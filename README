Memoize is a way to cache function's return value according to its arguments.
This distribution tries to inherit the sprit of Memoriz.pm from Perl, to make
such common routine easy to use.

Memoize speeds up your program in trad of memory space. However, the memory
consumption of a client-side javascript implementation is difficult to know,
so there's no benchmark for this distribution for now. But the saving of
numbers of calling the origial function could be calculated easily. Read tests
under t/ directory for such information.
